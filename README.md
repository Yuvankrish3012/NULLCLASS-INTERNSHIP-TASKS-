🧒 Age Prediction from Baby Images
This project uses deep learning to predict the Age of a person from their image using a pre-trained model. The model takes an image as input and outputs an estimated age in years.

🗂 Files
Age.ipynb – Main Jupyter notebook containing model loading, image preprocessing, and prediction logic.
8035dc76-c151-4fa1-acd0-04434181e1f5.png – Sample input image.
README.md – Project description and usage instructions.
🔧 Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
Install dependencies:

pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib notebook

🧠 Model Execution
Run the notebook using:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Age.ipynb
✅ Output
The model processes the image and predicts the baby's age. Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
1/1 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 0s 29ms/step
Predicted Age: 3.17 years
📝 Notes
The prediction may vary slightly depending on lighting, image quality, and expression.

You can replace the sample image with any baby image of your choice to test.

📌 Future Enhancements
Improve accuracy using a larger dataset

Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

Add age group classification (e.g., Infant, Toddler, Preschooler)
